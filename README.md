# StmModuleMockup
Mockap for an STM Module. Used for testing VIS and SPIS

- Unzip all files to a folder on your local computer.
- Start the STM Module by executing STM.StmModule.Simulator.exe with a parameter for the service instance that you want to work with. I.e. "STM.StmModule.Simulator.exe SMA001"

.NET Framework 4.6.1 needs to be installed on the computer to make it work.
